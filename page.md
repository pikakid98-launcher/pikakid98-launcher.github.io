### The Pikakid98 Launcher is currently (but slowly) being reworked to work on Linux (and hopefully Mac). I hope to use WINE for Mac and Linux support. Keep in mind that this is not my main priority

## For now, however. You can download the old version of my launcher
### Updater (Recommended):
[[Installer](https://github.com/pikakid98-launcher/updater-classic/releases/download/v2.3/PLUpdater.Installer.exe)]
[[Portable](https://github.com/pikakid98-launcher/updater-classic/releases/download/v2.3/PLUpdater.7z)]
[Source code: [.zip](https://github.com/pikakid98-launcher/updater-classic/archive/refs/tags/v2.3.zip) [.tar.gz](https://github.com/pikakid98-launcher/updater-classic/archive/refs/tags/v2.3.tar.gz)]

### Launcher (Without installer):
[[Binary](https://github.com/pikakid98-launcher/classic/releases/download/v0.6.1/Pikakid98.Launcher.exe)]
[Source code: [.zip](https://github.com/pikakid98-launcher/classic/archive/refs/tags/v0.6.1.zip) [.tar.gz](https://github.com/pikakid98-launcher/classic/archive/refs/tags/v0.6.1.tar.gz)]
